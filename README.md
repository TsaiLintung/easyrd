# easyrd - Regression Discontinuity Made Easy

**easyrd** simplifies regression discontinuity (RD) analysis and its standard checks.

**easyrd** is a wrapper around the **rdrobust** package

It is mostly  which facilitates standard procedures recommended in 

# Installation

To install **easyrd**, use the following commands in R. This package is hosted on GitHub, and devtools is required for installation:

```
# First, ensure devtools is installed
# install.packages("devtools")

# Install easyrd from GitHub
devtools::install_github("TsaiLintung/easyrd")
```

# Usage

**easyrd** simplifies the process of conducting RD analysis, from data simulation to analysis and visualization. Hereâ€™s a basic workflow:

```
# Load the package
library(easyrd)

# Simulate some example data
x0 <- runif(1000, -1, 1)
x <- runif(1000, -1, 1)
x2 <- runif(1000, -1, 1)
y <- 5 + 3*x + x2 + 2*(x >= 0) + rnorm(1000)
y2 <- 5 + 3*x + x2 + 3*(x >= 0) + rnorm(1000)
dt <- data.table(x = x, x2 = x2, y = y, y2 = y2, x0 = x0)

# Set parameters for RD analysis
outcomes <- c("y", "y2")
running <- "x"
cutoff <- 0
params <- get_param(outcomes, running, cutoff)

# Execute the main RD analysis
rd_result <- easyrd(dt, params)
plot(rd_result)
summary(rd_result)

```

Conduct standard checks recommended in [Cattaneo](https://www.cambridge.org/core/elements/abs/practical-introduction-to-regression-discontinuity-designs/F04907129D5C1B823E3DB19C31CAB905) (2019) with ease.

Validity checks:

```
# Predetermined Covariates and Placebo Outcomes
cov_params <- params
cov_params$outcomes <- c("x0") #
cov_result <- easyrd(dt, cov_params)


# Placebo cutoffs
cutoff_results <- easyrd(dt, params, alt_type = "cutoff", values = c(-0.1, 0.1))

# Density check is not included in easyrd but can be done easily with rddensity
#library(rddensity)
density_check <- rddensity(dt[,x], cutoff)
summary(density_check)

```

Sensitivity checks:

```
# Sensitivity to Observations near the Cutoff (donut)
donut_results <- easyrd(dt, params, alt_type = "donut", values = c(0.01, 0.02, 0.03))

# Sensitivity to Bandwidth Choice
bandwidth_results <- easyrd(dt, params, alt_type = "bandwidth", values = c(0.1, 0.2, 0.3))
```
